One day, you know, I had a dream
A lush color of white bloom
By my fire
From inside

Attune is a project to develop a new operating system for the HP 39gII graphing calculator. The project is inspired by the ExistOS project, a custom operating system for HP 39gII.

Attune is (yet another) a fun-focused operating system written from scratch, aiming to explore new features which are uncommon in calculator operating systems. The intended goal of Attune includes but is not limited to: ~~being written in pure Rust, enabling Jazelle DBX, multitasking, and ultimately being a drop-in replacement for ExistOS.~~ The intended goal of Attune is unclear and may or may not change in each phase of the project.

The project is divided into several phases, called “milestones”, and each milestone has its own goals and objectives. After completing each milestone, we will freeze the codebase and create a separate branch for it.

Attune is a personal project and is not affiliated with HP or any other organization.

## Build

The build process for the `master` branch is unclear and may or may not be stabilized in the future. For each milestone branch, the build process will be determined and documented within the corresponding branch.
